//! The VM side of cross-thread global sharing: publishing a program's dirty
//! shared variables into the [`ThreadSharedTable`] and adopting newer
//! published snapshots into the program's replica. Called at iteration
//! boundaries — the frame loop (via the `FrameDriver` implementations), the
//! audio callback batch (via `VmAudioDriver`), and `start-audio`'s
//! bootstrap publish. The tree-walking interpreter has its own `Value`-based
//! equivalents in `interpreter.rs`; both go through the same
//! [`ThreadSharedTable`] slots, index-aligned by the sorted shared-variable
//! list every compiled artifact carries.
